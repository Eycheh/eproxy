Title: todo file for my proxy

----------------------------------------------------------------------

   - Add support for DHCP clients other than pump
 
   - Improve makefile so that a SAE build is possible. Would make it
     possible for people who know nothing about erlang to use this.

   - Syntax errors in the config file cause a crash. Could be friendlier.

   - Dynamic DNS is only re-run if we re-login. Maybe some
     services change IP addresses _without_ logging out. Telia doesn't,
     as far as I know.

   - Add support for dynamic dns from suppliers other than zoneedit

   - Can't change the configuration without restarting. Idea:
     if I had a registered server which kept track of all my
     spawned processes, I could re-read the config file (say in
     response to someone telnetting to a certain port, or via
     to_erl) and then divide the servers into 

       {unchanged, changed, removed}

     I can leave the first alone, restart the second and kill
     the third.

   - The 'reflect' module has grown too complex. It should be broken up.

   - HTTP/1.1 proxy support might make a things go slightly faster

   - The bandwidth-throttling is a little simple-minded. It works
     well enough to stop one download from slowing down everything
     else, but it isn't smart enough to do that for multiple concurrent
     downloads. Wouldn't be hard to implement.
